    "post": "AITA for returning a birthday gift I got for my boyfriend after he insulted me about my \u201ccolorful\u201d past?\n\n**UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGE**\n\nThis happened last night but my phone is still blowing up. \n\nI F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday. \n\nHe knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn\u2019t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. \n\nSome background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. \n\nI found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn\u2019t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. \n\nAfter finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.\n\nI was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn\u2019t bother him.\n\nLast night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.\n\nHis best female friend Jessica laughed and said \u201cI wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.\u201d\n\nI looked at her with an \u201cexcuse me?\u201d Look on my face and she just said \u201cnevermind\u201d and walked away. \n\nI confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote \u201cshe\u2019s just messing with you. You can\u2019t take a joke?\u201d\n\nSo I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said \u201cwell, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.\u201d \n\nI asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said \u201cyou know\u2026messing with best friends?\u201d \n\nHe then pat me on the shoulder and said that it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m not who I was back then and if he could get over my \u201ccolourful past\u201d and \u201cthot mentalities\u201d to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica\u2019s comments and give her another chance.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.\n\nHe was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn\u2019t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.\n\nI thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they\u2019re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. \n\nI responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn\u2019t a \u201cthot\u201d and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. \n\nHe started screaming how I\u2019m \u201cthe biggest AH\u201d for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my \u201ccolourful past.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m thinking maybe taking it back went too far. \n\nAITA?",

    "post": "AITA for saying I'll be driving myself and paying for my own room on the upcoming family vacation so I won't have to be a babysitter?\n\nI 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.\n\nThis year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the \"Buts\" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.\n\nMy parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.\n\nNow my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.\n\nEdit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute.\n\nUpdate: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about.\n\nSmol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying \"Nope!\" to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work. \n\nThank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

    "post": "AITA for cancelling the entire vacation when I found out that my stepdaughters deliberately hid my daughter's passport to get her to stay home?\n\nI've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\nEditing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

The trashcan has a lid and there\u2019s a plastic garbage bag in there, so the pad was touching nothing but the trash that was already inside. \n\nI genuinely didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, until my boyfriend took out the trash this morning and noticed the plastic wrappers in the bag. He knew they were the packaging for my pads because he had seen them before and quite outraged, he asked whether my used pads were also in that bag. \n\nI told him yes and he dropped the bag, calling me disgusting and telling me to take out the trash myself.\n\nI did, but then asked him where else I should\u2019ve put my pads and he told me I could\u2019ve just kept them in my purse until I got home. \nI\u2019m staying at his place for three nights because we both have some time off, and I wasn\u2019t going to keep my used pads in my bag for days on end (imagine the smell\u2026).\n\nHe stated that he didn\u2019t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap.\nI don\u2019t think my attempt of an explanation why period blood isn\u2019t as disgusting as the thinks it is got through to him and he\u2019s quite set on his opinion.\n\nI think he was a bit childish because I don\u2019t understand how an adult straight man can be so disgusted by period blood, but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been outnumbered, I wanted to see whether other people also believe what I did was an AH move.\n\nEDIT: typos",

    "post": "AITA for \u201ckidnapping\u201d my baby, causing my husband to have a panic attack\n\nI 29 f recently started working again after having my daughter (4m). Daycare is too expensive so my husband 35m reluctantly agreed to stay home. It\u2019s important to know that he\u2019s been unemployed since 2021. He receives benefits. It\u2019s also important to know that he\u2019s extremely lazy. He doesn\u2019t cook, clean, or help out in any way. I was nervous about leaving her home with her father but I had no choice. \nWhen I came back from work she was clean, and sleeping. The next few times I came home he was either playing with her, feeding her, or out for a walk with her. I was happy. A few days ago my neighbor told me that as soon as I leave the baby cries and she cries for hours. My neighbor said that she knocked on our door and he finally answered it. He was sleeping. \nI concluded that he sleeps all day and right. Before I come home he pretends to care for her. I decided to take the day off of work, i left home at my regular time. Waited 30 minutes and then went home. Sure enough he was knocked out sleep with his stupid noise cancelling headphones on. \nI went to my daughters room, scooped her up and took her to my friends house. I waited about 2hours and I finally called him to tell him that I was coming home early. He called me back saying that he can\u2019t find the baby. He told me that he was going to call the police but before he did I told him what I did. He called me an asshole and a lot of other words too. When I got home his mother was there \u201ccalming his nerves\u201d because he has a panic attack. She also called me an asshole. My husband decided to sleep at her house. Family members are telling me that I\u2019m a terrible person. I know that it was extreme but I don\u2019t know if I would consider myself to be an asshole \n\n\n*English isn\u2019t my native language sorry about the grammar\n\n\nUpdate\u2014\u2014-sorry I created this account just to post my story I\u2019m not a big Reddit user. I missed so many wonderful messages from people. The last few days have been crazy. Once I finally told everyone what happened many took my side. My ex-husband and mother in law still think I\u2019m a jerk. \nMy friend allowed my daughter and I to move in with her. Which is nice, we were living in a bad area before so this can be a fresh start. My ex-husband has not asked to see my daughter for the past week. Online he\u2019s saying how I ruined his youth by trapping him with a baby. \nIdc anymore I\u2019m in a nice routine with my daughter. I took her to the hospital and they found signs of neglect. I explained the situation. The doctor advised me to press charges against my ex husband. I think I will.\n\nBut I\u2019m safe\nMy daughter is safe\n\nTbh i probably won\u2019t come back on Reddit. But I wanted to thank everyone for everything",

    "post": "AITA for leaving my husband at home, while I spend the week at my brothers, because of how he \u201cbuys\u201d groceries?\n\nI\u2019ve been in a committed relationship with my husband for 17 years, and overall, things have been great. We\u2019ve had a few rough patches, but what\u2019s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we\u2019re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.\n\nOne ongoing issue we have is my husband\u2019s frugality. He likes to control my spending and have the final say on how he uses his earnings. It\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019ve never used any of his income and have no intention to do so.\n\nHowever, the main point of contention between us is his frequent visits to food banks. Despite having more than enough food at home, he insists on going to food banks to save money. He intentionally looks disheveled and uses our beat-up car to blend in, even though he\u2019s never experienced food scarcity. I\u2019ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent. I suggested he volunteer or donate to gain firsthand experience, but he refuses. The unfortunate part is that since we\u2019re never short on food, most of what he brings home ends up getting thrown away.\n\nToday, I discovered our fridge filled with fresh produce and meat that clearly didn\u2019t come from our regular grocery store. When I confronted him, he admitted to going to a food bank after seeing a Facebook post about a donation of fresh food. People on social media were already asking if any was left, and there wasn\u2019t. I showed him these comments, but he brushed them off, claiming people should have gone earlier. Exhausted by the situation, I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother for the weekend, asking for space to think things over.\n\nMy husband accuses me of overreacting, being vindictive, and threatens to go back to the food banks regardless of my feelings. His family is also messaging me, calling me an asshole and urging me to stop interfering with his choices. I turned off my phone, but now they\u2019re bombarding my brother with messages. Thankfully, he supports my decision and ignores them.\n\nAll I want is to enjoy the rest of my week without being angry at my husband. Yes, I could let this go and not scold him, but the food he takes could have gone to people who truly need it. I\u2019m not leaving my husband, but I need a few days away to gain some clarity. Am I wrong for wanting this space?",

In actuality, Angel is entirely permissive and refuses to discipline them. She expects other adults to step in when Sofia and Parker\u2019s behavior is getting out of hand.\n\nFor this reason, I asked Angel to get a babysitter for Sofia and Parker if she wanted to attend my 27th birthday. I love Sofia and Parker as their aunt. And at the same time, I want a peaceful evening to celebrate my birthday instead of dealing with Sofia and Parker\u2019s behavior, because I know Angel isn\u2019t going to discipline them herself.\n\nAngel acted understanding when I made this request and explained my reasons to her in-person, but then she went online and made a Facebook post accusing me of hating Sofia and Parker and trying to punish Angel by only inviting our sister Jessica\u2019s kid Megan to my birthday dinner. (Nevermind that Megan is 17 and is practically an adult herself.)\n\nSeveral of our relatives and mutual acquaintances called me out and said I was an asshole and was excluding a 10 and 7-year-old. I responding to Angel\u2019s post by sharing two videos of Sofia and Parker misbehaving while Angel did nothing.\n\nThe first video was a recording taken by Megan, where Sofia and Parker were throwing tantrums and yelling at her. Megan was trying to calm Sofia and Parker down while Angel was on her tablet ignoring the situation.\n\nThe other video was one that Angel took. Sofia and Parker were yelling, throwing toys at each other, and Parker even called his sister a bad word. Angel was laughing as if it were funny and was again doing nothing to discipline Sofia or Parker.\n\nI wrote alongside the videos that I love Sofia and Parker as their aunt. But at the same time, I want a peaceful evening to celebrate my birthday. And I don\u2019t want to be stuck disciplining Sofia and Parker because clearly Angel won\u2019t. Angel ended up not coming to my birthday at all.\n\nMy parents told me that I was in the wrong for sharing those videos, because everyone\u2019s children have acted up and posting those videos didn\u2019t accomplish anything besides embarrassing Angel.\n\nThey also said I could have compromised by having a \u201cNobody under 18\u201d rule for my birthday dinner. Megan would not be able to attend but then Sofia and Parker wouldn\u2019t feel excluded. I do not see how that would be fair to myself or Megan. AITA For not wanting to make compromises for my birthday dinner?\n\nEdit: Hello, I wanted to clarify some common concerns about the videos. Firstly, both me and Angel's Facebooks are private, so the only people who are able to view the videos are people who either I or Angel have added as friends. A stranger will not be able to see them.\n\nAngel had already posted the video that she recorded of Sofia and Parker misbehaving, so I merely linked it. Megan had already posted the video that she recorded, just on a different social media platform. I am uncertain if Megan's social media is private, but no strangers will be able to view the videos from my and Angel's Facebook accounts.",

I wasn't happy (she's quite snobbish, almost in a comically villainous way. She once made fun of the fact that I get most of my groceries from the local big box super center and not somewhere with more \"high quality product\").\n\n  \nBut I love John and it mattered a lot to him, so I agreed.\n\n  \nOnto the issue: on the final night of my bachelorette party, we decided to have one \"big\" meal that was really pricey and fancy that we all saved up for. Sarah said she had to take an emergency work meeting and for us to go ahead first (the restaurant was walkable from our hotel).\n\n  \nGuys, when Sarah showed up, I was FLOORED. She came in a white sparkly sequin number with a tulle skirt and a tiara. When we were planning the trip, my MOH made it abundantly clear that everyone was supposed to wear pink so we could get a really cute photo together at the restaurant.  \nI'm not even kidding, her outfit was so bridal looking the waitress actually asked if we were having a joint bachelorette party. I was so upset, that when it came time to take photos I absolutely refused to have Sarah in them.\n\n  \nShe said it wasn't her fault because she \"didn't get the memo\", but I told her it was common sense to not wear a bridal looking dress to a bachelorette party if you're not the bride!Plus, she was in the group chat and even made comments about another girl's outfit when we were talking about what we wanted to wear, so I know she knew!\n\n  \nAll of my friends were on my side and they made sure she didn't end up in the photos. When we got home, she pitched a fit to my brother saying that we bullied her at my party and deliberately left her out. She was also pissed because a lot of family and friends noticed she wasn't in the photos and I wasn't afraid to tell them exactly why.\n\n  \nMy brother's really upset though because she's been crying and whining about it nonstop since. Apparently they're both so mad that they're going to skip father's day brunch, so the whole thing is blowing up even more.\n\n  \nI'm starting to feel bad because my mom told me that my brother and Sarah were fighting a lot now, so I'm not sure if I'm being the AH here.

    "post": "AITA for screaming at my husband and his sister to get out of my kitchen?\n\nMy husband's sister (38) lives with us and our kids. I'm well beyond fed up with her being here because of food issues. That's the only reason. \n\nSo, basically, every single time I make food his sister will come in and \"doctor up\" the food I'm making to her liking. Like I made steak and shrimp the other day (like Applebee's) and she waited until I left the room to put a full stick of butter in my shrimp- that was already done- and when I came back in, she goes \"I'm pretty sure that's the taste you were looking for\" and completely ruined it. It was trash. Or whenever I make spaghetti she will start dumping sugar in to the sauce, to a point of sweet spaghetti that me and my kids outright refuse to touch because it's nasty. Every single time that she can get away with it, she's doing something to the food. \n\nAnyways, my husband has started doing the same thing. I went to make home made Mac last night and cheese burgers. I went to the basement to the chest freezer to grab the veggies I needed and when I came back upstairs, my husband was putting canned chicken in to the Mac n Cheese (he knows the kids absolutely hate the taste of that) and his sister has pushing blocks of blue cheese in to the partially cooked burgers. I asked what the fuck they thought they were doing (because I've told them SO MANY TIMES to stop fucking with the food) and neither of them had any good excuse, other than \"we were just helping\". I flipped out and told them to get the fuck out of my kitchen. Both of them told me I was overreacting, etc etc.\n\nThe thing is, I've openly asked my SIL to cook several times and she won't. But she won't stop fucking with the food I'm making. My husband cooks often and I don't care if he screws with food he makes but it royally pisses me off when my cooking is messed with and he knows that. AITA?",

    "post": "AITA for denying an older woman shelter from a storm?\n\nI (23F) am an avid hiker in Australia. Last week I encountered a middle aged woman, around 50 years old as I was coming off a trail. She was walking in my direction as I came out of the bush. It was strange to see her, the sun was almost down and the weather was starting to turn. also, this was an intermediate collection of trails at best, difficult even for me at worst. and she didn't look super athletic. Point is, my 'weird' radar was going off already.\n\nShe walked up to me and stopped, standing too close for my comfort, gestured toward the clearing where my car was parked, and asked whether it was my car. No greeting or anything. When I looked over something made me uncomfortable- there were no cars other than mine in sight. The trail I was on isn't crazy far from civilization but it's not a walk away- one of those highway rest stops that's there for the trail and a few parking spots. no way she could have got there without driving.\n\nI let her know that, yes, it was my car, to which she responded something like \"Perfect, there's a storm coming, I can't be caught in it and I need to get home\". She was very matter of fact. It seemed like she had already decided what would happen. without waiting for my response, she started striding for my car. I am glad I always lock my doors because she would have hopped right in the passenger seat had the door opened.\n\nAs she was walking over to it, I went after her trying to explain that I wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to hitch a ride- asking why she was out here in the first place. I was talking to a brick wall until she realised the car was locked, at which point she turned around with this look of anger and frustration on her face. She starts ranting- the same stuff as before \"I NEED to get home\" \"A STORM is coming\" \"I CANNOT be caught in it\" \"Why don't you get it?!\". I was very confused at this point, and a little scared, as this woman was now a barrier between me and my vehicle. I told her something like 'I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable with having a stranger in my car'.\n\nShe stared me down for a few seconds, I guess trying to gauge her chances at asking again. And just like that, the anger drops from her face and she\u2019s silent. I was really uncomfortable. I asked if I could call someone, if there was another way to help. she starts walking- towards me (scary), but then right past me. I'm still asking her questions, then just saying things like \"hello\" and \"excuse me\". no response. She walked to the other end of the rest stop and maintained eye contact with me as she sat down on a log, then just stared at nothing.\n\nI didn\u2019t follow her. I got into my car really shaken up and drove away. As soon as I was back in cell range I called fire and rescue, they said they would send someone out. I was scared for my safety in the moment, but she was just some woman alone in the middle of nowhere. Am I the asshole for refusing this strange woman a ride/shelter in my car?",

    "post": "WIBTA if I go on vacation instead of my brothers wedding?\n\nMy brother Tom (36m) and I (26f) have never had a really solid relationship, due to our age gap we didn't spend much time and by the time I was old enough to develop a personality he was moved out of the house. \n\nFor the last two years my brother and his fiance Sarah (32f) have been planning their wedding. And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

    "post": "AITA for \"pregaming\" my wife's dinners?\n\nMy wife and I are both 32.\n\nSince we got married and moved in together five months ago, my wife has simply not made nearly enough food for me. This is not a kind of situation where I'm constantly agitated at her for incompetence or anything like that. I would be more than happy to microwave a burrito. I would be more than happy to whip up a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. \n\nBut I can't. My wife has, every single night of our marriage, done the same thing: she'll make me a tiny dinner. I'm talking like a Chinese chicken salad with 30 grams of chicken and ten leaves of lettuce arranged fashionably with dressing. When I finish eating, I'm still hungry because for a 230 pound man who works a physical labor job, it's not enough food. \n\nAt first, I tried to openly communicate with her, but she always took it horribly. She would adopt a thousand-yard stare, and then begin talking about how incompetent she is and how she can't even make her husband a proper dinner. I'd try to calm her down with \"Oh honey that's not the case! I just eat too much\" or \"Don't worry about it. I can make a bit more.\" I'd try to be overwhelmingly positive. It never helped. She would always just get incredibly disappointed in herself, cry, and/or take it out on me.\n\nThen she would make the same exact amount the following day.\n\nAfter the communication route failed, I tried to eat her dinners as-is. It became hard to sleep at night due to hunger and I lost seven pounds in the first month.\n\nEventually I figured out my own system. On my way home from work, I started swinging by a fast food restaurant and getting myself a burger. I would basically pregame her meals with some more calories. I figured it was win-win, as what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and I could have my fill of food. I would eat on my way home, walk in the door, pick at the salad or quinoa or homemade Mac and Cheese she made, compliment her for her delicious cooking, and later dispose of the wrappers discretely. \n\nTwo days ago I was on my way home and in line at a drive-through. My MIL was coming out of the restaurant. She ran over and greeted me. I asked her in a humorous way not to tell her daughter where she saw me because she'd take it badly, and she agreed, but then she narced on me anyway. I got home to a furious wife who demanded details. When I provided the truth she got extremely angry and looked legitimately hurt.\n\nI'm not good at handling confrontation and feel like I betrayed my wife in some way. Was I wrong here?",

We don't disagree a lot except, he always gets bothered whenever I eat different food from what he's eating when we go out. Like, if we're having dinner out and I order else, he'd instantly get upset and accuse me of treating him as less than when I just have different taste in foods.I'd just eat what he eats to keep the peace (I eat out alone as alternative) but since he clearly doesn't trust me, he'd randomly touch my plate to see if I'm having the same dish. This caused huge arguments between us and I told him to stop doing it and he said he would.\n\n\n\nWe went out to eat nights ago, and I ordered the same dish he ordered. When the food arrived, he looked somewhat uncomfortable. I asked what was wrong and he refused to say, and before I could even grab the fork he extended his arm and his hand touched the food on my plate. He moved quickly and started excussing what he did saying he \"just wanted to make sure...\" but I lost it on him, I felt so grossed out and there was no way I could eat the food after he touched it. He tried to get me to drop it saying i shouldn't be grossed out by his hand, and that I overreacted etc... but I grabbed his plate and told him that I was taking it as my donner. He at first asked meto be \"rational\" and give the plate back but I refused. An argument ensued and we had a fight. He then ended up leaving started spam texting me accusing me of being bitter, pathetic and childish, and robbing his dinner. He went to stay with his friend who picked him up and his friend sided with him saying I was in the wrong. Even went as far as to say that I was abusing my fiance and financially controlling him when I pointed out that I was the one who paid for the food.\n\n\nThe problem is magnified now with him wanting an apology and me refusing to give him one. My parents think I should have more patience and that this is just typical \"love spats\" between us but I'm not sure.\n\n\nWas I the ah with how I handled this?\n\n\nEDIT I want to point out that this is not the case when we ate at home, he has no issue with me eating different food.

    "post": "AITA because I got my daughter a $80 dress?\n\nMy family just got back from a weeklong cruise, and there is still some tension about this. My wife and I took our 20yo son, 16yo daughter, 13yo son and 7yo son. Our oldest spent most of his time on vacation doing his own thing, having breakfast and dinner with the family but being seldom seen otherwise. My wife and I enjoyed spending time with out kids, but we also did some couple's activities.\n\nThere are clubs on the boat for kids, and our 13yo really enjoyed them, but our 7yo didn't and kept wanting to spend the day with his sister, who we'd given carte blanche to do her own thing as long as she ate with us and answered when we messaged her. She was a good sport and took her little brother on most of her adventures, swimming with him, taking him to trivia and doing the animation classes with him. I felt like this was very sweet of her and showed a great deal of maturity. The second to last day of the cruise I took her to the gift shop and told her to pick out whatever she wanted as thanks for looking after her brother.\n\nShe was very excited and ended up picking out a dress. The dress was $80. She wore it to dinner that night, and when she told her mom I bought it for her my wife gave me a weird look. After dinner she asked me why the hell I did that. I explained that it was a reward for looking after her brother. She said we can't buy an $80 dress for our daughter and nothing for our sons. I said we didn't get them nothing; we took them on a cruise.\n\nMy wife said I'm an idiot. I don't think so. We got some trinkets for the younger boys, about $20 worth of stuff. My wife thinks I fucked up and said I should apologize to the boys. I refuse. We took our adult son on a vacation that cost thousands of dollars, he has no reason to resent his sister being rewarded for being thoughtful. If we got our 7yo and 13yo a really expensive souvenir, it would probably be lost or broken. She still thinks I was an asshole though.\n\nClarification: A lot of commentors seem to think we asked our daughter to babysit her brother. That's not really the case. What kept happening was that she would tell us her plans for the day and 7yo would say he'd rather do that than go to the kid's club, and she would agree to let him come with her. So it was more just her being a nice sister than actual babysitting. She always had the ability to drop him off at the club. That's why I wanted to reward her, because I thought it was so sweet of her not to do that and to make her brother feel good about his cool older sister wanting to hang out with him.",

I don't have the best relationship with my MIL as she always seem to police what I eat.\n\nEveryone in my family have fast metabolism, I am also working with horses so due to this burn a lot of calories (talking about 2.5-3k a day) and usually have rather large meals to get the energy back and I still remain skinny.\n\nNow to the event. My in-laws invited me and Nate for dinner last Friday. I was very busy back then and haven't eaten since about 6-7am and also didn't have a chance to have a snack before heading to the restaurant so I was starving (I usually have something to eat before seeing my MIL to avoid her comments). Due to this I have ordered a large steak at the restaurant which was meant for 2 people, it also came with prawns, bacon and 2 sides. Please note it was not the most expensive item on the menu as some of my in laws had significantly pricier dishes and we were all splitting the bill anyway.\n\nMy MIL started making comments how I shouldn't be ordering what I can't eat since even her husband wouldn't be able to finish the dish, let alone someone my size. I smiled and said I haven't eaten since early morning and am starving, if I don't finish the steak I will take the leftovers home.\n\nI have easily finished the steak and was waiting for my dessert, when my MIL flipped. She said I am attention seeking and was putting on a show, she also said I have made my FIL and BIL feel uneasy and that a woman shouldn't eat that much, it is unhealthy and something is wrong with me. She has then demanded me and Nate to cover the entire bill as she wasn't planning on \"such a big expenditure\". I said we are absolutely not covering the entire bill since it was meant to be split equally and reminded her of the dishes she ordered, that were significantly more expensive compared to my steak (including her starter). As a result I was called an asshole who has ruined a family dinner.\n\nNate is on my side but most of my in-laws are making very passive aggressive posts on social media about it and keep sending me different articles of \"what might cause excessive eating\".",

Both of us work and Alexis has attended daycare since she was 1. In the 2 years since, we have been asked to leave 2 programs because my wife is a micromanager. I admit both of us went into the first program not really understanding daycare. I quickly learned that they can\u2019t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. **She\u2019s in therapy and is working on it.**\n\nFirst program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn\u2019t understand why the other child wasn\u2019t punished for it. This daycare didn\u2019t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming \u201cone of those moms\u201d. \n\nWe chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn\u2019t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won\u2019t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn\u2019t get that opportunity. I thought all was well as the owner only speaks to my wife for the most part. \n\nThen, I get put in a group text saying my wife has been bombarding the owner with texts every day, despite the owner saying she will text her at lunch when things are settled. She said at this point, she will only be responding at specific times of the day and not looking the rest. The owner then added sent several pages of the contract with passages highlighted, reminding us of certain policies my wife had violated.\n\nI was pissed. When Alexis went to bed that night, my wife and I talked. I said this was our last option for daycare. The other centers are too expensive and this was the only home daycare in the area that we like. A nanny is not in our budget. My wife made a million excuses, including that it\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s anxious. I said if we are asked to leave this program too, my wife will be the one quitting her job to watch Alexis, not me. This upset my wife. I pointed out I\u2019ve spoken to her kindly about this plenty of times. I encourage her to keep up her therapy. But she can\u2019t keep getting us kicked out of programs. My wife is now not speaking to me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I cannot be the primary contact for daycare due to not being able to have my phone on me at work.",

Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her \"love\" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it.

She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done.

In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a \"take no shit\" attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences.\n\nMy co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single.\n\nLast Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour.

I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary.\" *Polite smile*\n\nHer: \"Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??\"\n\nMe: *Awkward chuckle* \"I'd rather not say, but it's up there!\"\n\nHer: \"What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??\"\n\nMe: *Visibly annoyed* \"No, I just prefer not to say.\"\n\nHer: *Laughs in my face* \"You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!\"\n\nMe: \"You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.\"\n\nThen I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand \"salary talk\". I think she's old enough. Husband is fully on my side but said maybe I should fake apologize for the sake of office politics, which I somewhat agree with. But still, AITA?",

She\u2019s been given a near 100% chance of survival since we caught it early, but the chemotherapy has destroyed her hair anyway, and she had to shave what was left of it off a few weeks ago. \n\nNot long after that, she suggested we attempt to get our 17 year old daughter, Anna, to do so as well. Anna has very long hair that she puts a lot of care into so I felt it was appropriate to ask her in private if she wanted to/would be willing to do such a thing. She told me that she didn\u2019t want to cut her hair and I figured that was the end of that. \n\nHowever yesterday they came home from a \u201cgirls shopping trip\u201d, something they do every so often, and Anna had a buzzed haircut. That struck me as odd after what she\u2019d said, so after dinner I talked to her and she told me that my wife had said she would never forgive Anna if she didn\u2019t show her support by buzzing her head. I asked her if she was happy about it and she said that she wasn\u2019t. \n\nWhen I went to bed, I brought it up with my wife and she said \u201cit was Anna\u2019s choice to or not, I just told her how I\u2019d see the situation.\u201d\n\nI told her off, saying she needed to respect Anna\u2019s personal choices and that a 17 year old girl being against shaving her head wasn\u2019t exactly out of the ordinary, however my wife simply said it was to show support for her. \n\nI\u2019ve been sleeping on the couch since.

    "post": "AITA for calling my daughters father Spineless and his girlfriend creepy over their name choice for their daughter?\n\nA little bit of context for you all, I ended up falling pregnant with my 10 year old daughter during a drunken hook-up with a friend in my mid 20s. Not the most glamourous or flattering truth but it's the truth all the same. When we found out we decided to keep the child and co-parent while remaining friends. We were never a couple and we didn't want to be one either.\n\nFour years ago he began to date his longterm girlfriend and they moved in together last year. She fell pregnant and i've been supportive to them both as much as I could be without crossing any lines; i've encouraged my daughter to help out whenever she's staying with them during the pregnancy and to behave, i've also made it clear that I want the children to have a close relationship despite having different Mothers, i've even said that if they were comfortable with it on nights I have my daughter if they ever want time alone i'll babysit once they have the baby so my daughter can spend time with her sibling.\n\nAll in all, I thought everything was great and I was excited for my daughter to have a sibling as she's always wanted one but I had no interest in having another child. Three days ago my friend and his girlfriend had a daughter, they asked me to bring my daughter to the hospital to meet her little sister yesterday alongside others of the family. So I did exactly that but when they introduced us to the baby I was shocked. They'd named used my daughters name. She didn't seem to have any issue with this when she introduced the baby bold as brass. My friend seemed uncomfortable and wouldn't look at me directly. I asked them what they were playing at, at which point my friends father said he'd take my daughter down to the cafeteria to get something to eat and left with her.\n\nMy friend told me to calm down and not overreact while his girlfriend told me she didn't see the issue and it was a pretty name. I asked them if they'd named the baby for my daughter trying to understand the logic here but his girlfriend said that no it was just a pretty name she liked. I then asked if they planned to use a nickname or a middle name when addressing to her on a daily basis and her response was that she didn't see a need for that.\n\nI told them they were being ridiculous and that they couldn't do this, I then told his girlfriend that I found this frankly creepy and told my friend he was being spineless if he was happy to go along with this. He tried to claim our daughter could use a nickname or something but I shut that down immediately asking why it was more reasonable for a girl who has used that name for a decade to shame her name compared to a baby who had no concept of what a name was yet.\n\nHis girlfriend told me I was being a bitch talking to her like that after she just gave birth and asked the nurses to remove me saying I was being disruptive.\n\nMaybe my temper is running a little too hot though and I was too harsh on her when she just gave birth. It's just so fucking weird.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to state, I know that what they want to name their child is their choice, they could have called her Dinosaur for all I care but this is one name that should be off limits or adjusted, they even have the same surname as they have the same father...Something about it just felt malicious and deliberate as if she's trying to replace my daughter and for them both to spring it on us like that at the first meeting? no that was weird.",

Then she had her son and of course, he was Abby\u2019s miracle rainbow baby, we were so happy for her. But then it leads to Abby spoiling her son and letting him get away with everything because he's a \u201cmiracle\u201d and he's \u201cspecial\u201d. Everyone has always bit their tongue when it comes to her son because of that. \n\nOn Saturday I had my daughter\u2019s first birthday party. It was mostly family and a few of my close friends were invited I invited Abby and her son because everyone else in our family was invited so I felt bad excluding her.  We had different activities for the kids to do. Abby\u2019s son didn't like any of them. He was upset none of the presents were for him. He didn't want to eat any of the food we had. He then decided to try and push the cake off the table because apparently, he was mad the cake wasn't his. I got super upset at Abby for allowing her son to act that way. She went on to say her son is special. I said her son is only special to her which is understandable. But to everyone else, he's a spoiled brat which shouldn't be overlooked because he was your special miracle baby. Abby called me a bitch and left crying. A few family members have since called me an AH because I've never dealt with a miscarriage so I don't understand how painful it was for Abby to deal with years of that before her son. It's not that I don't realize her son is special to her but it doesn't give the excuse for Abby to allow him to act like a spoiled brat.",

The teacher wanted to call all students by the Spanish version of their name (provided there was one). So, she tried to call Alexandra, Alejandra.

I am not the type of mom to write emails, but I felt I had to in this case.\n\nIf matters, this teacher is not Hispanic herself, so this isn\u2019t a pronunciation issue. Her argument is if these kids ever went to a Spanish speaking country, they\u2019d be called by that name. I found this excuse a little weak as the middle school Spanish teacher actually was Hispanic who had come here from a Spanish speaking country and she respected Alexandra\u2019s wishes.\n\nThe teacher tried to dig her heels in, but I said if it wasn\u2019t that big a deal in her eyes that she calls her Alejandra, why is it such a big deal to just call her Alexandra? Eventually, she gave in. Alexandra confirmed that her teacher is calling her by her proper name. \n\nMy husband feels I blew this out of proportion and Alexandra could\u2019ve sucked it up for a year (the school has 3 different Spanish teachers, so odds are she could get another one her sophomore year). \n\nAITA?",

Father/son time was put on an indefinite hiatus and instead dad told me we needed to include her in our time together but he also spent time with just her for father/daughter time. I brought it up to my dad and he told me I wasn't exactly making an effort to be closer to her so he wanted us all to bond and didn't want me to just focus on my relationship with him.\n\nHe has attended her dance things instead of my basketball games if they're on at the same time. It doesn't matter if mine was known about first, he will still skip my stuff to go to hers.\n\nHe will take us on family days and whenever he and his wife say \"kids can choose\" he picks her choices over mine. He claims it's because they will be the most fun for everyone but really, he even says it afterward, anything his little princess wants.\n\nOur refrigerator and our shower broke at the same time. His stepdaughter's birthday was coming up so he took money from my birthday fund to pay for that stuff and so his stepdaughter would definitely get what she wanted (this barbie house thing and a whole fashion set and they were I think dad said $250). He didn't get all the money back by the time my birthday came around so instead he bought me a $30 gift card for Steam when he had promised me a new monitor and keyboard for my computer (that was a gift from my grandparents).\n\nWhen my dad told me he wouldn't be at my graduation to go and support her, I told him there is no making up for that and he can forget about being included in my life going forward. He told me he would make it up to me and I told him I will always come second to his little princess and I'm not going to be okay with that. I told him he's discarded me for the last time. Dad begged me to be reasonable but I walked away. Then I invited both sets of grandparents who agreed to come. His wife told me I could have come with them and I don't need to attend the ceremony but could support \"my sister\". I said her daughter's not my sister and I do not want to support their family anymore and I will be out of their hair soon. She called me selfish and told me I can't deny her daughter a dad. \n\nAITA?",

I come from the opposite - my mother pretty much forbade from ever being financially dependent on a man and drilled that into me early on. \n\nMy husband worked hard to unlearn the values he saw replicated at home. He (often more than) pulled his weight at home, was an engaged and present father and a genuine partner. The one thing that grinds my gears is how much weight he puts on the opinions of his family. I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much.\n\nMy ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works. \n\nMy ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home. When I am a guest in their home, I accommodate their ways and play the DIL they wish I was. They have for the most part respected this. \n\nI got home yesterday after work tired and starving. I typically get home 1815/30 and we eat at 1900. I said quick hellos and ran up for a pre-dinner shower. When I came down, I went to the kitchen to help set up for dinner and found nothing ready. I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat. My husband and his parents served themselves and joined us. \n\nMy MIL was still going on about what was wrong with me and why I was a failure. I asked my husband if he had anything to say. He said his mother had a point and it wouldn't hurt if I acted 'more like a proper woman' and 'took better care of my home and children'. He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me.

It has been hard on our family and even harder on her. I love my sister and I tried to be there for her as best as I could. I also did everything I could to make things easier for my parents. I took over all chores, cooked everyday, cleaned the house, did laundry, took care of my younger sibling and babysat them more.\n\nLuckily she is doing really well and has recently finished her treatment which is great and we are all grateful.

    "post": "AITA for laughing in my cousin's face when she tried to stage an intervention for my \"drug use?\"\n\nI (27M) have a condition which causes me to overproduce earwax. I don't tell people about it because I was bullied for it growing up. Only my wife and parents know. Every other day, I have to put medication in each ear, let it sit, then flush it out with a rubber tipped syringe. This prevents ear infections, vertigo, permanent hearing loss, and worsening of my tinnitus. I have dealt with all of these things to some extent, so I stay on top of my eardrop regimen. If my alarm goes off when I'm with others, I go to the bathroom for 20 minutes and knock it out. If I don't follow my schedule I forget, so I can't put it off. \n\nTwo weeks ago, my mom hosted family dinner. My cousin Kara (37F) saw me waltz off to the bathroom to do my thing, syringe in hand, and asked what I was doing. I said just a minor medical thing. She kept pushing but I didn't want to say anything because she gossips. I told her it's personal and scooted past. When I left, she was standing in the hallway. She asked what took so long and why the toilet didn't flush. I said none of her business. She said she didn't mean to offend. \n\nLast weekend, my friend called me to invite me out to lunch with some buddies. He said  to meet up at his house so we wouldn't have to drive separately. I arrive at his house to find Kara and my friends sitting solemnly on the couch. Kara said they were here to talk about my \"problem\" and that they just wanted to help. I said there is no problem. Suddenly it clicked in my head what this was about. I couldn't help but laugh a little bit out of shock. She asked what was so funny, and I said first of all why didn't you talk to my wife or my parents? She said she didn't want to involve my \"enablers\" which just made me laugh harder. She looked annoyed and said she was done trying to help. I said that's alright by me She stormed out. \n\nI explained to my friends. They knew I have a condition but never pressed me on it, I guess when Kara approached them they thought I was lying. Obviously I'd rather they know than worry about me being an addict when l'm not. I thanked them for their support anyways. Kara had apparently reached all of my friends by through my social media. We all got a good hearty laugh out of it, which Kara must have heard because she was, of course, eavesdropping. She burst back in and told me to tell them the truth, to which I said I did. My friend kicked her out. We went for lunch and I thought that was that. \n\nMy mom called me yesterday and told me she had talked to Kara about the whole thing and explained. She said Kara was very upset with me and essentially called me an asshole for not explaining, and laughing in her face and embarrassing her. I said I was embarrassed and that Kara had no right to my info. I think she shouldn't go around snooping and making assumptions. My mom still thinks I should apologize.\n\nETA: She didn't see my alarm go off, just ran into me on her way from the kitchen.

    "post": "AITA for not ordering any food so I wouldn't have to split the bill?\n\nI(27M) have been apart of a small friend group, around 8 people total, basically since college.\n\nFor some background, 2 people from the group, Susan and Greg, are just absolute leeches. Going out for lunch? Expect them to order the most expensive on the menu then feed you some sob story about their finances and then dumb half the bill on you.\n\nLast weekend, Dan, one of the people from the group, told me about a casual dinner . I told him how if Susan or Greg were there I wouldn't be able to come. He tells me that they would be there but I should just put my opinions aside and come just once.\n\nThis is kind of where I might be an AH. I agreed with him and told him I would be there. I show up and we all get to talking.\n\nEveryone began putting in their orders, most of them spent about $40. There were only about 6 people there. When it gets to Susan and Greg, they both order expensive dishes, around $200. When it was my turn to order, everyone looked at me, but I just pick up the menu and point to the $4 Miller Lite and sent the waiter away. Dan asked why I hadn't ordered anything and all I said was that I lost my appetite. The other 2 friends got up as well to cancel their orders and just have drinks.\n\nAfter the main courses came out, I saw Susan and Greg picking at their food. The waiter then brings over the check. Greg then grabs the waiter and asks him to split the check 6 ways. I stand up and correct him saying the check was to be split 3 ways. Greg looks at me confused and asks why since we \"always\" split the bill. I reminded him that 3 of us had not eaten any food so we would just be paying for our drinks.  So basically at the end of the night, Dan, who probably only ate around $50 worth of food, was stuck with a $146.98 check at the end. (Yes, I remember the exact number.) I swear I saw his jaw drop when he picked that receipt up.\n\nI slid a $10 towards the check, said goodbye everyone, and walked out.\n\nThe next morning, I found my phone full of texts from Greg and Susan telling me I was an AH for not ordering any food and forcing them to pay  more than they had accounted for. I honestly laughed because the steaks alone were more than what they had paid  but to each their own right?\n\nI also got a lot of messages from Dan saying that I could have just not came instead of pulling that stunt and getting him stuck with an outrageous bill.\n\nEdit: At this restaurant, the bar is separate so drinks are on a separate bill if that makes sense. And if anyone is concerned about leaving a tip, I live in Australia.\n\nEdit 2: Hey guys just wanted to clarify some things:\n\n1. 90% of restaurants where I live they don't do separate checks and might separate the bill for you if you're lucky. BTW. This post is in AUD, so if you want the amounts in USD, you have to convert it.\n2. Dan could have easily asked Greg and Susan to transfer him the money if he wanted but he's always been about helping them through their \"financial hardship\" even though they're just using him and keeps dragging me into it. I admit what I did was immature but I'm tired of being forced to play along. It's his money and if he wants to spend it on them, that's fine, but I'm not paying for them.\n3. Also Dan's a really good friend of mine, albeit blind AF. I was just trying to get him to see what kind of people he was \"helping\". I will admit it was a tad bit petty.\n4.

I think if you google \u201ccoolors blue sage peach\u201d you\u2019ll see a similar palette.\n\nMy neighbor Paul fucking hates it and has been complaining since we started the project.

If he has so much free time to bitch and moan about a colorful house, maybe he should get a hobby.\n\nHe stormed off, calling me a nasty piece of work. My niece was cracking up on the side. For the record, no one in my family is uptight, we really don\u2019t care about cursing. I know some people still clutch their pearls over it around kids (she\u2019s 15) but I\u2019m sure she says worse. \n\nAnyway one of the other neighbors came to tell me that he\u2019s been flapping his yap about how disrespectful I am to talk to him like that.

Then Sarah comes, asking about my wife\u2019s clothes. \n\nI told her my wife wanted me to donate them to this women's shelter, and she often helped. It will help women in need with their own court cases, court appointments, and job interviews. \n\nMy sister Sarah said my wife was even selfish in death. I asked her what the fuck did she mean? And she started going off on how my wife always thought she was better than her, and it's not far that the clothes are going to charity and not to family. \n\nI told my sister I would rather see my wife\u2019s clothes lit on fire than on her back.

    "post": "AITA for not telling my husband's family that I speak their language?\n\nMy husband Peter (29 m) and I (27 f) have been married for about three years. We have one child together and I was pregnant with our second. I\u2019m western Canadian while he is from Germany. We lived in Canada for a long time, but because of inflation moving back to Germany seemed like a better option for us. We bought a nice house in Hannover where Peter is from.\u00a0\n\nThe day after our flights to Germany we all visited Peter\u2019s family. This was the second time I have seen them (the first was at our wedding). They greeted us and brought us inside of the house, fussing over my son. We had dinner, and soon we left the house, wanting to settle into our new home. We visited Peter\u2019s family often for the next few months. But I had started to realize that they would sometimes speak about me in German. They would make rude comments on my hair and makeup, question my fashion choices, and overall were just very unkind to me. They also said mean things about my pregnant belly which I was already insecure about.\n\nI ended up talking to my husband about this. I told him that I didn\u2019t like the way that they were treating me. I said that I hated how my every choice was judged. He told me that he would talk to his family.\u00a0\n\nThe next time that we went to his parents house, there were no more mean comments. For about three months it was like nothing ever happened. I gave birth to a perfect baby girl that we named Lilith. Peter\u2019s family was very upset when they heard the name. If you didn\u2019t know, Lilith means \u201cghost\u201d or \u201cof the night.\u201d We didn\u2019t pick this name because of its meaning, but because it is a name that every girl in my family has had for many years. My middle name is Lilith, along with my moms, my grandma\u2019s, and even my great grandma's.\u00a0\n\nFor a while I didn\u2019t visit my in-laws. I didn\u2019t want to hear them talk about how I shouldn\u2019t have named my daughter Lilith. But yesterday we saw them again. It was my mother-in-law\u2019s birthday. As soon as we showed up things started to go badly. Everybody wanted to hold Lilith which made my MIL upset because people weren\u2019t paying attention to her and made me overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t want people holding her. I was going through a pretty bad postpartum depression and it was still pretty early to see people. I let people look at her, but declined when anyone asked to hold her.\n\nDuring dinner I heard my SIL talking to my MIL in German. I heard her complaining about how she couldn\u2019t hold my baby. My SIL even had the audacity to call me, and I quote, \u201ca fat ugly hokey addict.\u201d I turned to my SIL and MIL and told them off in German. I basically said that I have always known what they have said about me, but calling me names was the last straw. I also mentioned how I have known German for almost my whole life. The table instantly blew up. People were yelling at me because apparently this was all my fault. I left with Peter and we haven\u2019t talked to them since. So AITH?",

Last year I (17f) officially changed my first name from Evelyn to Indie (which was a nickname form of my original middle name). My parents gave in after realizing how serious I was about being Indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. \n\nMy brother and Hailey want an older/vintage name for their baby and Hailey asked me about 5 months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change the name. At the time she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names and to me it sounded really old fashioned. I told her the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like Indie instead. I didn't mind her asking this first time.\n\nShe brought it up again a week later and she asked the same question and pressed more for why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking me. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening to her. She also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like Indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to stop her. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either.\n\nTwo weeks ago when she brought it up again she felt like I had made a mistake changing my name and how 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name and Indie seemed like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kinda lost my temper. She started out asking the same stuff and the baby is almost ready to be born so I know it's coming to an end but she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped and I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change and her comments are not changing my mind because I don't like old fashioned names. I told her I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing about how much better they are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates Indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me.

They always made it so obvious they resented being parents so young and added to that they never tried to be good parents. I typically spend most of my time at friends houses. I don't have extended family to rely on, they disowned my parents for having me so young, so friends houses were a positive in my life that made me feel more comfortable than being at home with my parents.\n\nMy parents never did the typical parent stuff like helping with homework or showing up to support me at school. I don't think they ever attended a parents conference for me. They ignored a lot of stuff I needed to get signed and I'd have to get right in their face on the last day to get signatures.

I ask if she offered the person sitting next to her son her seat in economy plus, she said she \"needed the leg room\". I said clearly she cares more about her own comfort than her son's well being, if she cared she would give up her seat and move to the back. She breaks out in a screaming wail filled with \"HOW COULD YOU\"S Ten min later a smiling man sits down next to me grinning about his sweet upgrade.

    "post": "AITA for not telling a man that the research he was mansplaining to me was my own? \n\nI don't normally post on reddit so please forgive me if I do this wrong. \n\nI (33f) work in a very small, technical, specific, male dominated field. I won't give too much information on it as I think you could easily find my identity if I did, but let's just say it's a sub category of law. \n\nI graduated 9 years ago (for anyone wondering, the system in my country is different than in the US so I only studied for 5 years), and am now a lawyer as well as a researcher. I published some work here and there but nothing too major, and no one outside of that field knows my work. \n\nYesterday I went to a bar with a couple of friends who introduced me to one of their friends who works in the same field as me. I was pretty excited to meet him because it's rare to meet people who work in that field. He doesn't exactly do the same thing as I do, he's not a lawyer but a legal advisor, but we work on the same topics. So naturally we started talking about our work. \n\nAt one point we were discussing a point on which we had different opinions, so I explained mine to him and he replied by saying that my opinion was based on nothing while his was based on the work of a professional (you guessed it, me). He basically started explaining my work to me, but in a completely wrong way and missed all of my points. I asked him if he was sure that that was what the author meant and he said that he was because it was \"pretty simple actually\". For another good 20 minutes he explained all of it to me in details, like I was a first year law student. I didn't say anything because it was pretty funny to watch him say things that were completely wrong with so much confidence. \n\nAfter that the topic changed and the night went on, but at the end of the night right before leaving I decided to tell him that I was actually the person that wrote the work he had quoted, and that he hadn't really understood it. He reacted very badly and got angry, and he told me that I had manipulated him to humiliate him. He yelled at me for not saying it was my work at the beginning. I simply replied that he had embarrassed himself and left. \n\nI woke up this morning to texts from my friends saying I was wrong for causing drama and tension and that I could've been nicer to their friend. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong there. I mean yes, I could've told him right away, but is it that big of a deal that I didn't? I'm not exactly sure. AITA? \n\nEdit: I forgot to make this clear and maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding, but both conversations happened only between the two of us. We were the only ones talking about our work and our friends also weren't really there when I told him that I was the author. So it's not like I publicly humiliated him. The only thing \"embarrassing\" for him here is that a woman seemed smarter than him, and I think that's what ge had an issue with.\n\nEdit 2: I've seen some comments claiming that this post was fake because \"that just doesn't happen\", \"i've seen many other stories where the same thing happens\", \"that's not realistic\". I'm not trying to justify anything because I don't really care, but I just find it funny to see lots of comments from women sharing similar stories and then lots of comments from men saying it doesn't happen.",

I was able to give it to her last weekend. She\u2019d asked for it in certain colors. I didn\u2019t have any other projects on my to do list so I was happy to make it for her. I had most of the colors already too so it worked out.\n\nWhen I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over, I figured it was to see how it was put together, since she doesn\u2019t crochet. After a little bit she said that she loved the blanket, BUT she couldn\u2019t help but notice some of the little mistakes I\u2019d made along the way. I asked her what she meant, and she pointed out some things like I\u2019d accidentally done one row of striping instead of three for one section, I\u2019d switched to the wrong color and threw off a \u201cpattern\u201d at some point, etc. \n\nShe handed it back to me and told me that she loves my progress with it and couldn\u2019t wait to see the finished project. I told her that it was finished. She looked down at it and said that it wasn\u2019t done until it was perfect, and I\u2019d made several mistakes that I could easily go back to correct.\n\nI was honestly dumbfounded by this. I hate the way perfectionists try to force their quirk onto others. I made this blanket for her for free out of my own free time because I love her. I told her that. She said she knows and she loves me for it but that she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on anything but the mistakes.\n\nI said whatever and took the blanket back and said that if she doesn\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll keep it. She looked surprised and said that she does want it, she just wants my best work and not something half assed. I told her that if she thinks me crocheting A WHOLE FUCKING BLANKET and making minimal errors is half assing it, I\u2019d rather just keep the blanket.\n\nShe\u2019s so upset with me and told me I was acting ridiculous and that it wouldn\u2019t take me long to fix it. If you know anything about crochet you know that if I made an error on row 36 of a 1115 row blanket\u2026 that\u2019s essentially starting over again. Anyway I come to you all lol AITA?",

    "post": "AITAH for playing a voice recording to prove to my friend her daughter isn\u2019t nonverbal?\n\nSo I (30f) have a friend (34f) that has a \u201cnon-verbal\u201d daughter (3f) let\u2019s call her Allie. I watch her 4 days out of the week in my in-home daycare.\n\n **I require contracts for every child and she never filled out the special needs section. And at no point when she asked me to take Allie did she mention any type of speech delay or non speaking issue..** \n\nAlthough Allie didn\u2019t speak much at first (I figured she was shy) she communicated her needs to me very well and said small things to me frequently. Last month I was in the bathroom (I keep the door BARELY cracked with a wedge so I can listen for any dangers and they can\u2019t walk in on me or see me) she walked by and said \u201cEw you stinky\u201d. I laughed and told her mom at pickup what she said and I was met with \u201cSHE ISNT VERBAL WHY WOULD YOU MOCK HER\u201d I reassured her that Allie has spoken to me quite a few times and I thought that it was a huge milestone from when she first arrived and was barely saying anything. She told me she didn\u2019t believe me and that it was messed up that I would make up something like that to upset her. I told her that I wasn\u2019t trying to upset her but I wasn\u2019t lying either. I didn\u2019t press the issue further. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the AH. I decided to record Allie (a voice recording, not her face) telling me her name and what her favorite animal is. \n\n** I had full intention of showing mom the recording, but I was scared at first because of her blowup at me and I didn\u2019t know how she would react. After a few short pickups and drop offs she told me it was water under the bridge and that she didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. She even insisted that I went to the birthday party. After that I was just happy Allie could continue and I ended up forgetting I had the recording at all. \n\nFast forward to Friday (about a month later) she had a birthday party for her other child. At the party I was socializing with other family members (Honestly I\u2019m a total dumbass for forgetting that her family fully thought that she was nonverbal) I mentioned the funny things Allie has said to me while we were reading an animal book. Turns out the person I was talking to was her sister and she started yelling at me saying \u201cSHE IS NON-VERBAL WHY ARE YOU LYING\u201d. Both her and her sister start berating me saying that it\u2019s f*cked up that I\u2019m making this up about Allie being verbal. At this point I\u2019m tired of being called a liar. I have two disabled children whom my son was non-verbal for many years. I wouldn\u2019t lie about something like this. So while everybody was staring at me I was scared and felt backed into a corner. So I (remembering I had the recording) decided to prove my case and play the voice recording. Everybody was shocked and my friend told me to leave. I told her I didn\u2019t want to cause issues but I\u2019m not gonna be berated and called a liar. She said that I crossed the line recording her daughter and that I\u2019m an a**hole for embarrassing her at the party. Now I feel horrible and wondering if I should have just let it go..\n\nEdit for clarification and extra context: \n\nWhenever she would pickup and drop off she wouldn\u2019t ask me much other than \u201chow was her nap, how much did she eat\u201d and I would hand her the daily report then she would leave and not stay for small talk even when I would try to initiate.  \nI know people have busy lives so I\u2019m not gonna try to make them stay and talk to me about their life story. \n\nI also didn\u2019t do the recording to embarrass her in any way. I didn\u2019t mean any vindication by it. I can admit I should have shown her immediately after I recorded it but I\u2019m also human and I was afraid of a second blow up. Then after her saying it was water under the bridge I was just happy that she wasn\u2019t gonna take Allie away so I put it in the back of my mind and forgot about it. \n\nI feel bad about how I went about my defense (hence the post). I know it was unprofessional and unethical. I apologized profusely to everybody at the party and the family as well. \n\nI will be putting cameras in my home that everybody will have access to as well as updating all the contracts to let parents know what is going to happen going forward. Peace of mind for everybody sounds good to me! Also, I will be making a call to cps about the situation and see what they have to say. \n\nThank you everybody for your kind words \u2764\ufe0f",

On a recent trip, one woman who was travelling alone (mid-30s) was consistently oversleeping. \n\nThe first day after we arrived, we had a day trip to Etna and Taormina, for which we depart at at 8 am, as we do all other day tours. I make sure that all tourists are informed of the departure times on the bus the day before and they also have my number to call in case they forget so I can remind them. They also all have printed out pamphlets with the schedule made by the travel agency that I hand out that has the time for departure on it. \n\nAll of the group was on time, except one woman. She was late by 10 minutes, which, okay, maybe she got caught up in something and was late. I excused it, then mentioned to the whole bus in the mic that I do not tolerate lateness beyond 15 minutes at most in case of emergency like a forgotten possession, and that I must ALWAYS be called and informed in case someone is running late. Trip went by okay otherwise. \n\nThe next day this same tourist was late again, by TWENTY FIVE minutes. Almost an entire half hour. I called her twice to no answer and we were just about to leave without her when she came out running and got on the bus (she got lucky, as the receptionist of the hotel asked me about a missing piece of info on the rooming list and earned her some time). I reminded everyone AGAIN that I will not be waiting anymore for late tourists in the morning, and waking up on time is their responsibility. \n\nWhen we came back that evening, she asked me if I could 'make sure to wake her up on time'. I reminded her a THIRD time that I\u2019m not responsible for waking people up. Everyone gets a printed itinerary with departure times, and I announce everything the day before. She kept saying, \"No, no, just knock on my door if I\u2019m not out by 8:15\" and I kept repeating \"I really can\u2019t do that for everyone, please set an alarm.\"\n\nWell, on the day we were visiting Syracuse, she didn\u2019t show up. I waited 15 minutes after the supposed departure time, called her twice to no response, then left with the bus and the rest of the group. She called me in a panic about an hour later asking where we were. I explained the situation calmly. She got angry and said that I had one job and that I cheated her out of the money she paid to go on that day trip.\n\nShe missed the whole day trip and was furious the next day. Later she told the rest of the group that I abandoned her and also called my agency, leaving a bad review about me.\n\nAITA for not personally waking up a grown woman despite warning her multiple times I wouldn't? \n\nEDIT: I talked to my manager today!! I was nervous at first because I was already tired of this whole shenanigan and didn't want to spend ages defending myself, so I went to him first and explained the situation before he approached me. He told me, word for word, \"Hun, I deleted that bs from my e-mail as soon as I read it\" LOL! An icon. They'll remove the bad review!",
